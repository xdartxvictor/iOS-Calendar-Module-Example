# iOS-Calendar-Module-Example
Sometimes an app needs access to platform API, and React Native doesn't have a corresponding module yet. Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift or C++ code without having to reimplement it in JavaScript, or write some high performance, multi-threaded code such as for image processing, a database, or any number of advanced extensions.

We designed React Native such that it is possible for you to write real native code and have access to the full power of the platform. This is a more advanced feature and we don't expect it to be part of the usual development process, however it is essential that it exists. If React Native doesn't support a native feature that you need, you should be able to build it yourself.

This is a more advanced guide that shows how to build a native module. It assumes the reader knows Objective-C or Swift and core libraries (Foundation, UIKit).
